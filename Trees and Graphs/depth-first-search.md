Depth-First Search (DFS) and Depth-First Traversal

Depth-first search (DFS) is a method for exploring a tree or graph. In a DFS, you go as deep 
as possible down one path before backing up and trying a different one.

Depth-first search is like walking through a corn maze. You explore one path, hit a dead end, 
and go back and try a different one.

Depth-first search is often compared with breadth-first search.

Advantages:

- Depth-first search on a binary tree generally requires less memory than breadth-first.
- Depth-first search can be easily implemented with recursion.

Disadvantages

- A DFS doesn't necessarily find the shortest path to a node, while breadth-first search does.
