Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a philosophy that you should avoid repetition in your code.

Making code more DRY could involve taking repeated lines of code and factoring them out into a utility function.

Code that isn't DRY is sometimes called WET, which could stand for "Write Everything Twice" or "We Enjoy Typing."

Or "Wild Elderberry Tart."
