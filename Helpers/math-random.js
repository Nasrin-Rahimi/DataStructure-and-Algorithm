/**
Math.random()
The Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range 0 to 
less than 1 (inclusive of 0, but not 1) with approximately uniform distribution over that 
range â€” which you can then scale to your desired range. The implementation selects the 
initial seed to the random number generation algorithm; it cannot be chosen or reset by 
the user.

Note: Math.random() does not provide cryptographically secure random numbers. Do not use 
them for anything related to security. Use the Web Crypto API instead, and more precisely 
the window.crypto.getRandomValues() method.
