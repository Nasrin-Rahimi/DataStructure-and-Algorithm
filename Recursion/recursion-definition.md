Recursion is an approach to solving problems using a function that calls itself as a subroutine.

You might wonder how we can implement a function that calls itself. The trick is that each time a recursive function calls itself, it reduces the given problem into subproblems. The recursion call continues until it reaches a point where the subproblem can be solved without further recursion.

A recursive function should have the following properties so that it does not result in an infinite loop:

A simple base case (or cases) â€” a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer.
A set of rules, also known as recurrence relation that reduces all other cases towards the base case.

So one of the ideas about how to divide the problem would be reducing the input string at each step into two components: 1). the leading and trailing characters. 2). the remaining substring without the leading and trailing characters. We then can solve the two components independently from each other.
