Output: 1024.00000

Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100

Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25

/**

Approach 1: Brute Force
Intuition

Just simulate the process, multiply x for n times.

If n < 0, we can substitute x, n with 1/x, -n to make sure nâ‰¥0. This restriction can 
simplify our further discussion.

But we need to take care of the corner cases, especially different range limits for 
negative and positive integers.

Algorithm

We can use a straightforward loop to compute the result.

        ans = ans * x;
