An array is a basic data structure to store a collection of elements sequentially. But elements can be accessed randomly since each element in the array can be identified by an array index.

An array can have one or more dimensions. Here we start with the one-dimensional array, which is also called the linear array.

An array has a fixed capacity and we need to specify the size of the array when we initialize it. Sometimes this will be somewhat inconvenient and wasteful.

Therefore, most programming languages offer built-in dynamic array which is still a random access list data structure but with variable size. For example, we have vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java.

Dynamic Array in JavaScript means either increasing or decreasing the size of the array automatically. JavaScript is not typed dependent so there is no static array. JavaScript directly allows array as dynamic only. By addin element to array, the size of array will be increased and by deleting elment from array, the size of array will be decreased. 

 2D Array
Similar to a one-dimensional array, a two-dimensional array also consists of a sequence of elements. But the elements can be laid out in a rectangular grid rather than a line.

In some languages, the multidimensional array is actually implemented internally as a one-dimensional array while in some other languages, there is actually no multidimensional array at all.
