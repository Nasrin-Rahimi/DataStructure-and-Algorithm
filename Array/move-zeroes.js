Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Input: nums = [0]

/**
 * Approach #2 (Space Optimal, Operation Sub-Optimal) 
 This is a 2 pointer approach. The fast pointer which is denoted by variable "cur" does the job 
 of processing new elements. If the newly found element is not a 0, we record it just after 
 the last found non-0 element. The position of last found non-0 element is denoted by the slow 
 pointer "lastNonZeroFoundAt" variable. As we keep finding new non-0 elements, we just overwrite 
 them at the "lastNonZeroFoundAt + 1" 'th index. This overwrite will not result in any loss of 
 data because we already processed what was there(if it were non-0,it already is now written at 
it's corresponding index,or if it were 0 it will be handled later in time).

After the "cur" index reaches the end of array, we now know that all the non-0 elements have 
been moved to beginning of array in their original order. Now comes the time to fulfil other 
requirement, "Move all 0's to the end". We now simply need to fill all the indexes after the 
"lastNonZeroFoundAt" index with 0.

total operations (array writes) that code does is n (Total number of elements).
  */

/**
 * Approach #3 (Optimal)
 * The total number of operations of the previous approach is sub-optimal. For example, the 
 * array which has all (except last) leading zeroes: [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1].How many write 
 * operations to the array? For the previous approach, it writes 0's nâˆ’1 times, which is not 
 * necessary. We could have instead written just once. How? ..... By only fixing the non-0 
 * element,i.e., 1.

The optimal approach is again a subtle extension of above solution. A simple realization is 
if the current element is non-0, its' correct position can at best be it's current position 
or a position earlier. If it's the latter one, the current position will be eventually 
occupied by a non-0 ,or a 0, which lies at a index greater than 'cur' index. We fill the 
current position by 0 right away,so that unlike the previous solution, we don't need to 
come back here in next iteration.

Therefore, when we encounter a non-zero element, we need to swap elements pointed by current 
and slow pointer, then advance both pointers. If it's zero element, we just advance 
current pointer.
