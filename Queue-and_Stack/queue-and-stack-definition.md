Queue:
In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the queue will be processed first.

To implement a queue, we may use a dynamic array and an index pointing to the head of the queue.

As mentioned, a queue should support two operations: enqueue and dequeue. Enqueue appends a new element to the queue while dequeue removes the first element. So we need an index to indicate the starting point.

Let's consider a situation when we are only able to allocate an array whose maximum length is 5. Our solution works well when we have only added less than 5 elements. For example, if we only called the enqueue function four times and we want to enqueue an element 10, we will succeed.

And it is reasonable that we can not accept more enqueue request because the queue is full now. But what if we dequeue an element?  We remove element from the first of array and have size but we cann't add any element because the end of array is full.

A more efficient way is to use a circular queue. Specifically, we may use a fixed-size array and two pointers to indicate the starting position and the ending position. And the goal is to reuse the wasted storage we mentioned previously.
